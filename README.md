# Professional Portfolio Application

## Description

A professional porfolio application was requested to provide examples of my work as a junior developer.  The application includes a section with contact information, information about me, and images with embedded links to my deployed applications.  The application is responsive and allows for improved viewing experiences on smaller screens.  A "Website in progress.  Thank you for your patience." message is still included on the site as I plan to udpate and maintain the site as my development work continues.
